## About Game
Call break is a quite popular game among card game players in South Asian countries. Call Break is a variation of Spades game, usually played among 4 players. Players shuffle and distribute 13 cards each, and play 5 rounds to complete one game. Call Break, also known as ‘call brake’ is a relatively long-run game played with 52 cards deck between 4 players with 13 cards each. It’s game rules are pretty easy to learn.
In Call Break game, after the cards are distributed, each player needs to declare the number of hands they expect to win out of 13 available hands called call or bid. They must declare a minimum of 1 hand. Declaring the number of hands they expect to win in the round is considered as making a call. The purpose of the round is to win as many hands as possible, breaking the call. The main objective of this game is if you can break a call from other players then you will win the game. If you can stop getting their call then you will win the game. 
In this game, you must try to take at least as many hands as you call or bid. If you take fewer tricks than that you call, you lose the amount of your call. If you take tricks more than or equal to the call, you get points equivalent to call + 0.1 points for every extra hand.
